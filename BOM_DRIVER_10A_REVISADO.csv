ALTERACOES REALIZADAS:
1. INDUTOR: NR8040T100M (3A) -> SRP1265A-100M (12A) - CRITICO para 10A
2. C3: 47uF -> 100uF 63V - Maior capacitancia para ripple
3. C4: 4.7uF 80V -> 10uF 100V - Maior margem de tensao e capacitancia
4. D1: B560A -> B560C (package SMC maior para dissipacao)

CALCULOS DE VERIFICACAO:
- Corrente de saida: I = 0.1V / R_sense = 0.1V / 0.01R = 10A
- Potencia no Rsense: P = I^2 x R = 100 x 0.01 = 1W (usando 3W OK)
- Indutor saturacao: 12A > 10A (margem 20% OK)
- Tensao entrada: 12-24V DC (recomendado 24V para 20 LEDs em serie)
